## 🛑 Problem Statement

Many CS/SE students struggle to identify suitable career paths due to lack of guidance, unstructured learning, and limited exposure to different technology domains. Traditional career counseling methods are often generic and do not provide actionable insights based on individual skills and thinking patterns. Tech Path AI addresses these issues by providing AI-powered assessments, personalized career guidance, structured learning modules, and gamified motivation to help students make informed career decisions and track their progress.
